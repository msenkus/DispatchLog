# DispatchLog

To run this HTML I use NPM serve library to spin a local host on port 5000. Then open google chrome to view. 

This program is a simple dispatch log created to help my dispatcher at work log emergancy incedents. The current log process requires manual input of data such as dates and times. This process although simple becomes very tedious when multiple calls are coming in at once. This system is ment to streamline some of these processes. The file uses Bootstrap to make the page easier to read and look more modern.  

1) Clicking the blue (T) button shall automatically enter the time of occurance. This time shall be edited. 
2) Clicking the "Date" at the top left corner shall autofill the date.
3) Select the current shift during time of operation. 


Areas for future improvement. 
1) Although this list does not get long during each shift, create a dynamic program to add additional slots incase the list fills up. 
2) Create the PHP to store into a database. Check with corporate to avoid data silos and if they would like to add.
